## Introduce

Design a set of experimental system for testing the core components of industrial robots RV reducer and harmonic reducer, use some  data-driven methods to provide condition estimation of reducers. Apply some   optimization algorithms to optimize the layout of monitoring sensors. Finally Develop a complete online-monitoring system, including hardware installation and PC software development to achieve the condition monitoring of core components of industrial robots. 

## Project source

Funded by National Internet development project (ZGZZ20190004) $352 Thousand , as well my graduate design.

## Overall Plan

The overall plan is shown in the figure below.
