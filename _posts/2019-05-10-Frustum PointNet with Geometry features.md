## Introduce

Reviewed the related entropy theories which have been applied for condition monitoring of rotating machinery, including bearing, gear, motor,  turbine, engine etc. As well conducted some case studies to prove the validity of the theory . These works are shown below:

## Project Source

Funded by National Internet development project (ZGZZ20190004) $352 Thousand 

## A case study

In this case study, we carry out the comparison between the observation method and the permutation entropy selection method for the input of remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of a turbine engine. The challenge data of the 2008 Prognostics and Health Manage Conference are utilized. Experimental results are shown below:

By observing these two figures, it can be seen that the predicted RUL in the second picture is close to the true RUL, which means that these experimental results are better.
