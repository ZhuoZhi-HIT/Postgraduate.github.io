## Introduce

Design a set of experimental system for testing the core components of industrial robots RV reducer and harmonic reducer, use some analysis methods to analyse the collected sensor signal and achieve earlier warning and diagnosis of the reducer fault. Finally Develop a complete online-monitoring system, including hardware installation and PC software development to achieve the condition monitoring of core components of industrial field robots. 

## Project source

Funded by National Internet development project (ZGZZ20190004) $352 Thousand , as well my graduate design.

## Test system

- Platform base
- Motor
- Test object: RV reducer, harmonic reducer etc.
- Load motor
- Rolling guide
- Sensors: Acoustic emission sensor, Vibration sensor, Torque sensor etc.
- Data collector:
- PC software

## The analytical method to be used

### (1) Basic time and frequency domain analysis methods

- Fourier transform
- Wavelet transform
- Power spectrum analysis
- Hilbert demodulation

### (2) Artificial intelligence methods

- BP neural network
- Combination of genetic algorithm and neural network
- Fuzzy neural network
- Wavelet analysis and neural network fusion

## The project will be launched soon and updated continuously...
